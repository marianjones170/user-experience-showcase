// Exercise 12: Collections.
// I wrote some JavaScript functions that make use of arrays and objects for this exercise. I was given a starter code and asked to fill in the blanks.
// To begin, I was given some code. I wrote code to call a function when the page loads; the function is set to demoLoop, which contains a "for loop."

var daysOfWeek =
 ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
function demoCollections() {
  var result = "";
  // Use of Array Objects
  result += "<p>" + "First day: " + daysOfWeek[0] + "</p>";
  result += "<p>" + "Last day: " + daysOfWeek[daysOfWeek.length - 1] + "</p>";
  // This is a for loop through array objects.
 for (var i = daysOfWeek.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
   result += "<p>" + daysOfWeek[i] + "</p>";
